15.2 What are the different types of joins? Please explain how they differ and
     why certain types are better in certain situations.


Solution:

Join is used to combine the results of two tables. To perform a join, each of
the tables must have at least one field which will be used to find matching
records from the other table. The join type defines which records will go into
the result set.

Let's take for example two tables: one table lists "regular" beverages, and 
another lists the calorie-free beverages. Each table has two fields: the
beverage name and its product code. The "code" field will be used to perform
the record matching.

    Regular Beverages:
    ---------------------------------
    |Name          |            code|
    ---------------------------------
    |Budweiser     |       BUDWEISER|
    ---------------------------------
    |Coca-Cola     |        COCACOLA|
    ---------------------------------
    |Pepsi         |           PEPSI|
    ---------------------------------

    Calorie-free Beverages:
    -------------------------------------
    |Code          |                Name|
    -------------------------------------
    |COCACOLA      |     Diet Coca-Cola |
    -------------------------------------
    |FRESCA        |              Fresca|
    -------------------------------------
    |PEPSI         |          Diet Pepsi|
    -------------------------------------
    |PEPSI         |         Pepsi Light|
    -------------------------------------
    |Water         |      Purified Water|
    -------------------------------------

Let's join this table by the code field. Whereas the order of the joined tables
makes sense in some cases, we will consider the following statement:
    [Beverages] JOIN [Calorie-free Beverage]
i.e. [Beverage] is from the left of the join operator, and [Calorie-free
Beverage] is from the right.

1. Inner Join: result set will contain only those data where the criteria match
   . In our example we will get 3 records: 1 with COCACOLA and 2 with PEPSI
   codes.

2. Outer Join: Outer join will always contain the results of inner join,
   however it can contain some records that have no matching record in other
   table. Outer joins are divided to following subtypes:

   2.1 Left outer join, or simply left join: The result will contain all
       records from the left table. If no matching records were found in the 
       right table, then its fields will contain the NULL values. In our 
       example, we would get 4 records. In addition to inner join results, 
       BUDWEISER will be listed, because it was in the left table.

   2.2 Right outer join, or right join: This type of join is the opposite of
       left join; it will contain all records from the right table, and missing
       fields from the left table will contain NULL. If we have two tables A
       and B, then we can say that statement A left join B is equivalent to 
       statement B right join A.
       In our example, we will get 5 records. In addition to inner join results
       , FRESCA and Water records will be listed.

   2.3 Full outer join: This type of join combines the results of left and
       right joins. All records from both tables will be part of the result set
       , whether the matching record exists in the other table or not. If no 
       matching record was found then the corresponding result fields will have
       a NULL value.
       In our example, we will get 6 records.
