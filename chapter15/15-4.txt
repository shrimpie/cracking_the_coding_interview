15.4 Draw an entity-relationship diagram for a database with companies, people,
     and professionals (people who work for companies).

Solution:

People who work for companies are Professionals. So there is an ISA (is a) 
relationship between People and Professionals (or we could say that a 
Professional is derived from people).

Each Professional has additional information such as degree, work experiences,
etc, in addition to the properties derived from People.

A Professional works for one company at a time, but Companies can hire many 
Professionals, so there is a Many to One relationship between Professionals and
Companies. This "Works For" relationship can store attributes such as date of
joining the company, salary, etc. There attributes are only defined when we 
relate a Professional with a Company.

A Person can have multiple phone numbers, which is why Phone is a multi-valued
attribute.

The figure is stored within the same folder titled "15-4.png".
