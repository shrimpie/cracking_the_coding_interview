15.5 Imagine a simple database storing information for students' grades. Design
     what this database might look like, and provide a SQL query to return a
     list of the honor roll students (top 10%), sorted by their grade point
     average.


Solution

In a simplistic database, we'll have at least these three objects: Students,
Courses, and CourseEnrollment. Students will have at least the student name and
ID, and will likely have other personal information. Courses will contain the
course name and ID, and will likely contain the course description, professor,
etc. CourseEnrollment will pair Students and Courses, and will also contain a
field for CourseGrade. We will assume that CourseGrade is an integer.

Our SQL query to get the list of honor roll students might look like this:

    select studentName, GPA
    from (
    	select top 10 percent Avg(CourseEnrollment.Grade) as GPA,
    		   CourseEnrollment.studentID
    	from CourseEnrollment
    	group by CourseEnrollment.studentID
    	order by Avg(CourseEnrollment.Grade)) Honors
   	inner join students on Honors.studentID = Students.studentID

This database could get arbitrarily more complicated if we wanted to add in
professor information, billing, etc.
