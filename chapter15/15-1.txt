15.1 Write a method to find the number of employees in each department.


Solution:

This problem uses a straight-forward join of Departments and Employees. Note
that we use a left join instead of an inner join because we want to include
Departments with 0 employees.

    select dept_name, departments.dept_id, count(*) as 'num_employees'
    from departments
    left join employees
    on employees.dept_id = departments.dept_id
    group by departments.dept_id, dept_name
