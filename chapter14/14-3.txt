14.3 What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize?


First attempt:

Well, I'll make some guesses. 

final has different meanings for class, methods
and variables. A final class cannot be subclassed. A final method cannot be 
overridden. A final variable cannot be modified.

For finally, it's a block that got executed no matter what after a try/catch
block.

As for finalize, I'm not sure about this.


The answer:

final
When applied to variable (primitive): The value of the variable cannot change.
When applied to variable (reference): The reference variable cannot point to
any other object on the heap.
when applied to a method: The method cannot be overridden.
When applied to a class: The class cannot be subclassed.

finally
There is an optional finally block after the try block or after the catch block
. Statements in the finally block will always be executed (except the JVM exits
from the try block). The finally block is used to write the clean up code.

finalize
This is the method that the JVM runs befores running the garbage collector.
