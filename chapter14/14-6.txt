14.6 Suppose you are using a map in your program, how would you count the
     number of times the program calls the put() and get() functions?


First attempt:

If I am using a map, I would simply count the times they get called. Am I
missing anything?


The answer:

One simple solution is to put count variables for get() and put() methods and,
whenever they are called, increment the count. We can also achieve this by
extending library map and overriding the get() and put() functions.

At first glance, this seems to work. However, what if we created multiple
instances of the map? How would you sum up the total count for each map object?

The simplest solution for this is to keep the count variables static. We know
static variables have only one copy for all objects of the class so the total
count would be reflected in count variables.
