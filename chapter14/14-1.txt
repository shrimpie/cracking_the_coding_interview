14.1 In terms of inheritance, what is the effect of keeping a constructor
     private?

First attempt:

Private constructor makes the instantiation of the class impossible from outside
the class. This is a technique used when designing singleton pattern.

Correction: Provide a static public method, you can implement Factory pattern.



The answer:

Declaring the constructor private will ensure that no one outside of the class
can directly instantiate the class. In this case, the only way to create an
instance of the class is by providing a static public method, as is done when
using the Factory Method pattern.

Additionally, because the constructor is private, the class cannot be
inherited.
