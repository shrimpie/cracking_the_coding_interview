16.4 Write a step by step execution of things that happen after a user presses
     key on the keyboard. Use as much detail as possible.


Solution:

1. The keyboard sends a scan code of the key to the keyboard controller (Scan
   code for key pressed and key released is different).
2. The keyboard controller interprets the scan code and stores it in a buffer.
3. The keyboard controller sends a hardware interrupt to the processor. This is
   done by putting signal on "interrupt request line": IRQ 1.
4. The interrupt controller maps IRQ 1 into INT 9.
5. An interrupt is a signal which tells the processor to stop what it was doing
   currently and do some special task.
6. The processor invokes the "Interrupt handler". CPU fetches the address of
   "Interrupt Service Routine" (ISR) from "Interrupt Vector Table" maintained 
   by the OS (processor use the IRQ number for this).
7. The ISR reads the scan code from port 60h and decides whether to process it 
   or pass the control to program for taking action.
