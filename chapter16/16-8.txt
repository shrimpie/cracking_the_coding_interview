16.8 A device boots with an empty FIFO queue. In the first 400 ns period after
     startup, and in each subsequent 400 ns period, a maximum of 80 words will 
     be written to the queue. Each write takes 4 ns. A worker thread requires 
     3 ns to read a word, and 2 ns to process it before reading the next word.
     What is the shortest depth of the FIFO such that no data is lost.

Solution:

Not so sure about the solution. But from what I understand, a maximum of 160 
writes at the end of first period and the start of the second period would give
the worst case scenario. For this case, 640 ns of writes is needed (160 * 4 ns
= 640 ns), and during the same time, only 128 words could be processed (640 / 
( 3 + 2) ns = 128). So plus one slot due to that first read cannot start until 
the first write has finished (why is this?), and another slot to ensure a write
does not trash the contents of a concurrently occuring read. Thus a safe
estimate of the queue length is 34 (160 -128 + 1 + 1 = 34).

Please rethink about this problem.
