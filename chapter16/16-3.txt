16.3 Describe direct memory access (DMA). Can a user level buffer / pointer be 
     used by kernal or drivers?


Solution:
Direct memory is a feature which provides direct access (read/write) to system 
memory without interaction from the CPU. The "DMA Controller" manages this by 
requesting the System bus access (DMA request) from CPU. CPU completes its 
current task and grants access by asserting DMA acknowledge signal. Once it 
gets the access, it reads/writes the data and returns back the system bus to 
the CPU by asserting the bus release signal. This transfer is faster than the 
usual transfer by CPU. Between this time CPU is involved with processing task 
which doesn't require memory access.

By using DMA, drivers can access the memory allocated to the user level buffer
 / pointer.
