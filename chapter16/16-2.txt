16.2 What is a Branch Target Buffer? Explain how it can be used in reducing 
     bubble cycles in cases of branch misprediction.


First attempt:

Wow, never heard of this thing. Is it some kind of technique to increase the 
program execution speed by predict next instructions?


The answer:

Branch misprediction occurs when CPU mispredicts the next instruction to be 
executed.

The CPU uses pipelining which allows several instructions to be processed 
simultaneously. But during a conditional jump, the next instruction to be 
executed depends on the result of the condition. Branch Prediction tries to 
guess the next instruction. However, if the guess is wrong, we are penalized
because the instruction which was executed must be discarded.

Branch Target Buffer (BTB) reduces the penalty by predicting the path of the 
branch, computing the target of the branch and caching the information used by
the branch. There will be no stalls if the branch entry found on BTB and the 
prediction is correct, otherwise the penalty will be at least two cycles.
