chapter13 C++
A good interviewer won't demand that you code in a language you don't
profess to know. Hopefully, if you're asked to code in C++, it's listed on
your resume. If you don't remember all the APIs, don't worry -- your 
interviewer probably doesn't care that much. We do recommend, however,
studing up on basic C++ syntax.

C++ vs Java
A very common question in an interview is "describe the differences between
C++ and Java." If you're not comfortable with any of those concepts, we 
recommend reading up on them.
1. Java runs in a virtual machine.
2. C++ natively supports unsigned arithmetic.
3. In Java, parameters are always passed by value (or, with objects, their
   references are passed by value). In C++, parameters can be passed by
   value, pointer, or by reference.
4. Java has built-in garbage collection.
5. C++ allows operator overloading.
6. C++ allows multiple inheritance of classes.

Question: which of these might be considered strengths or weaknesses of C++
or Java? Why? In what cases might you choose one language over the other?
