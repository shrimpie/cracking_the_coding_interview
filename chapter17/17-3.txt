17.3 Compare and contrast the IPv4 and IPv6 protocols.


Solution:

IPv4
1. Most widely used protocol right now.
2. 32 bit addressing.
3. Five different types: A, B, C, D and E. A,B,c are used in common practice. D
   reserved for multicast. E simply reserved.
4. Notation: 239.255.255.255, 255.255.255.0


IPv6
1. Next generation protocol for internet.
2. 128 bit addressing.
3. Three types: Unicast addresses, multicast addresses, and anycast addresses.
4. Notation: 8 groups of hexadecimal quartets separated by colons.

IPv6 can provide solution for:
1. Increased address space
2. More efficient routing
3. Reduced management requirement
4. Improved methods to change ISP
5. Better mobility support
6. Multi-homing ?
7. Security
8. Scoped address: link-local, site-local, and global-address space.
