17.1 Explain what happens, step by step, after you type a URL into a browser. 
     Use as much detail as possible.


Solution:

There is no right, or even complete, answer for this question. This question 
allows you to go into arbitrary amounts of detail depending on what you're 
comfortable with. Here's a start though:

1. Browser contacts the DNS server to find the IP address of the URL.
2. DNS returns back the IP address of the site.
3. Browser opens TCP connection to the web server at port 80.
4. Browser fetches the html code of the page requested.
5. Browser renders the HTML in the display window.
6. Browser terminates the connection when window is closed.

One of the most interesting steps is Step 1 and 2 - "Domain Name Resolution". 
The web addresses we type are nothing but an alias to an IP address in human 
readable form. Mapping of domain names and their associated Internet Protocol
 (IP) addresses is managed by the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a 
 distributed but hierarchical entity.

 Each domain name server is divided into zones. A single server may only be 
 responsible for knowing the host names and IP addresses for a small subset of
 a zone, but DNS servers can work together to map all domain names to their IP
 addresses. That means if one domain name server is unable to find the IP 
 addresses of a requested domain then it requests the information from other 
 domain name servers.
