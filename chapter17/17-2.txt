17.2 Explain any common routing protocol in detail. For example: BGP, OSPF, 
     RIP.


Solution:

Depending on the reader's level of understanding, knowledge, interest or career
aspirations, he or she may wish to explore beyoung what is included here. 
Wikipedia and other websites are great places to seek for a deeper 
understanding. We will provide only a short summary.

BGP: Border Gateway Protocol

BGP is the core routing protocol of the Internet. "When a BGP router first 
comes up on the Internet, either for the first time or after being turned off, 
it establishes connections with the other BGP routers with which it directly 
communicates. The first thing it does is download the entire routing table of 
each neighboring router. After that it only exchanges much shorter update 
messages with other routers.

BGP routers send and receive update messages to indicate a change in the 
preferred path to reach a computer with a given IP address. If the router 
decides to update its own routing tables because this new path is better, then 
it will subsequently propagate this information to all of the other neighboring
BGP routers to which it is connected, and they will in turn decide whether to 
update their own tables and propagate the information further."

RIP: Routing Information Protocal

"If one network goes down, the network can quickly adapt to send packets 
through another connection."


OSPF: Open Shortest Path First

Faster than RIP, but also more complex.
RIP only keeps track of the closest router for each destination address, while 
OSPF keeps track of a complete topological database of all connections in the 
local network.
