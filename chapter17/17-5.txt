17.5 What are the differences between TCP and UDP? Explain how TCP handles 
     reliable delivery (explain ACK mechanism), flow control (explain TCP 
     sender's / receiver's window) and congestion control.


Solution:

TCP: Transmission Control Protocol
1. Connection-oriented.
2. Reliable, a message is guaranteed to arrive, unless the connection fails. It
   will get re-transmited if lost.
3. Ordered
4. Heavy-weight: when TCP streams arrives in the wrong order, resend requests 
   have to be sent.

UDP: User Datagram Protocol
1: connectionless
2: Unreliable
3: Not ordered
4: Lightweight


For each TCP packet, the receiver must acknowledge that the packet is received.
If there is no acknowledgement, the packet is sent again.

A TCP window is the amount of outstanding (unacknowledged by the recipient) 
data a sender can send on a particular connection before it gets 
acknowledgement back from the receiver.

Congestion control:
additive-increase-multiplicative-decrease scheme, slow start.
