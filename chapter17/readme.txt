Networking


How to approach
---------------

While the big software houses probably won't ask you many detailed networking 
questions in general, some interviewers will attempt to assess your 
understanding of networking as far as it relates to software and system design.
Thus, you should have an understanding of http post and get requests, tcp, etc.

For a more networking based company (Qualcomm, CISCO, etc), we recommend a more
thorough understanding. A good way to study is to read the material below, and 
delve further into it on Wikipedia. When Wikipedia discusses a concept that you
are unfamiliar with, click on the concept to read more.


OSI 7 Layer Model
-----------------

Networking architecture can be divided into seven layers. Each layer provides 
services to the layer above it and receives services from the layer below it. 
The seven layers, from top to bottom, are:

Level 7: Application Layer
Level 6: Presentation Layer
Level 5: Session Layer
Level 4: Transport Layer
Level 3: Network Layer
Level 2: Data Link Layer
Level 1: Physical Layer

For a networking focused interview, we suggest reviewing and understanding 
these concepts and their implications in detail.
