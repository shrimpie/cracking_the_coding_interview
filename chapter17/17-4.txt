17.4 What is a network / subnet mask? Explain how host A sends a message /
     packet to host B when: (a) both are on same network and (b) both are on 
     different networks. Explain which layer makes the routing decision and 
     how.

Solution:

Simple version

The mask is to get the network address by AND operation between the network 
mask and the IP address. The remaining bits indicate host addresses.

If they are on the same network, host addresses are used to identify each 
other.
If they are on different network, the router uses network mask to identify the
network. The host addresses are used to identify each other too.

The network layer is responsible for making routing decision. A routing table 
is used to store the path information and the cost.
